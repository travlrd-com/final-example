## TRAVLRD Interview Project

1. Fork the repository or use it as a template or clone with `pnpx degit https://github.com/travlrd-com/final-example.git`.
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. Follow the steps outlined here: https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/setting-up-your-database
   - Initialize a new repository and publish it to Github (also make sure to set the repo to public)
   - Sign into your Vercel account and deploy your repository as a new project
   - Install the Vercel CLI: https://vercel.com/docs/cli
   - Run `vercel link` to link your project to the Vercel CLI
   - Create a new Postgres database on Vercel
   - Connect the database to your project via the dashboard (this will automatically add the postgres environment variables to the project)
   - Upload the remaining two environment variables to the Vercel project settings from the `.env.example` file
   - Run `vercel env pull .env.development.local` to make the latest environment variables available to your project locally
   - Run `vercel dev` to start the development server
4. Seed the database by opening `/seed` in your browser. This will create a user account that you can use to log in to the dashboard
5. Complete the interview task
6. Send us the link to your GitHub repo and the link to your deployed app (don't forget to set to public both the **GitHub repo** and the **Vercel deployment**, and make sure the **environment variables** are not tied to localhost)

We will test your assessment from the deployment link that you provide, so make sure every feature is working on the deployed version as well.
